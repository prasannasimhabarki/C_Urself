            Hi, Iâ€™m Prasanna Simha Barki, a full stack Java developer currently working at
            TEKsystems Global Services, Bengaluru. I created this page to guide my juniors
            who often feel confused about career paths in Computer Science. I want to share
            my knowledge and help them explore different domains, such as Web Development,
            Mobile Development, Data Science, and more. This page is designed to provide
            a clear roadmap and resources to help them make informed decisions.
          </p>
