          <h2>What is Data Science?</h2>
          <p>
            Data Science is like solving a mystery! Imagine you have a huge pile of information, 
            like numbers or facts, and your job is to find patterns or trends in them. <br /> <br />
            Data scientists use computers to understand this data, and then make decisions or 
            predictions based on it. Itâ€™s used in many places, like predicting the weather, 
            recommending videos, or finding ways to make cars safer!

          <h2>What is Data Analysis?</h2>
          <p>
            Data Analysis is like being a detective. You take the data you have and look closely at it 
            to figure out what's happening. It helps in understanding trends, finding problems, and 
            answering important questions. <br /> <br />
            Analysts use tools like graphs, charts, and math to study the data and give people helpful 
            information. For example, a company might use data analysis to find out which product is 
            selling the most.

          <h2>Why is Data Science Important?</h2>
          <p>
            Data Science is important because it helps people make smart decisions. Whether it's 
            improving business, finding the best way to treat a patient, or helping sports teams win, 
            data science gives people the information they need to do better. <br /> <br />
            From your favorite apps to helping scientists make discoveries, data science is everywhere!
