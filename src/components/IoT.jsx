          <h2>What is IoT?</h2>
          <p>
            Imagine you have toys that can talk to each other. That's kind of what the Internet of
            Things (IoT) is. It means that things like lights, cars, or even your fridge can talk
            to each other through the internet! <br /> <br />
            So, if you have a smart light, you can turn it off using your phone. That's because
            they are connected through the internet, just like how you talk to your friends online.

          <h2>How Does IoT Work?</h2>
          <p>
            IoT works by using sensors. Sensors are like the eyes and ears of the devices. 
            They collect information, like how hot it is or if a door is open. Then they send
            this information over the internet to other devices, like your phone, so you can
            know what's happening. <br /> <br />
            Itâ€™s like magic, but with technology!

          <h2>Why is IoT Important?</h2>
          <p>
            IoT is important because it makes our lives easier. Imagine your fridge telling you
            when you're out of milk or your car telling you when the tire needs air. <br /> <br />
            It helps people save time, keep track of things, and even stay safe. That's why so many
            things are becoming smart, like watches and even homes!

            If you're interested in learning about IoT, Coursera has some great courses. 
            You can start by understanding how sensors work and how to connect devices to the 
            internet. Learning about coding and electronics will also help! <br /> <br />

            In VVCE, you will learn about topics like sensors, networks, and communication that
            are the base for IoT. Start with understanding how electronics work, and dive into
            programming languages like <strong>Python</strong> or JavaScript to control IoT devices. <br /> <br />
            There are also specialized courses on IoT where you can get hands-on experience.
            Practice is key in this field!
